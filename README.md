# 21_Days_Dhairya_Umrania
Name: Dhairya Umrania
I am an LY IT student, so I have knowledge about python and Exploratory Data Analytics. I have recently finished a machine learning theoritical course online, so I have basic knowledge about few of the machine learning algos. Last week, I have started with another course on machine learning on udemy where it is more practical based. It uses python. I also started with an online course on MS Excel.

My level would fall somewhere between intermediate and advanced, as for the roadmap, I will be using the resources provided by dataZen from time to time as well as my own resources.

This is my work for the 21 days of data science:

Day 1: Created Git repo, continued on my ML course, and Excel course.
Day 2: Continued with excel course, continued with ML course, started refering to notes provided by DataZen.
Day 3: Learned about clustering and how to implement it in python.
Day 4: Learned further about clustering, learned about different methods: K means, Hierarchical, etc, also continued with Excel course.
Day 5: Continued further with both ML and Excel course.
Day 6: Continued with both courses and also learned about image processing in Deep learning
Day 7: Learned about neural networks, learned about Apriori in ML
Day 8: Learned about Eclat and Continued with Excel course. Also started working on data collection of one of my projects.
Day 9: Learned about NLP, continued with project, and also looked for possible project ideas of Data Science/Analytics. 
Day 10:
